# Social Media Toxic Comments Text Classification

This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with different Word Embeddings and Machine Learning models to classify Social Media comments on whether they are toxic or non-toxic in nature. 

Different classification models are trained on the same dataset before comparing and identifying the best model for the classification task. Subsequently, the best model was utilised to classify web-scrabed Youtube comments to evaluate the model's performance. 

## Techniques
- Deep Learning Framework (TensorFlow)
- Text Data Preprocessing
- Word Embeddings (GloVe & BERT)
- Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN)
- Web Scraping of Youtube Comments (Selenium Library)

## Future Roadmap
- Implement Dense Layer on BERT as a Classifier
- Integrate Model into Flask REST API
