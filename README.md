# Social Media Toxic Comments Text Classification

This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with different Word Embeddings and Machine Learning models to classify Social Media comments on whether they are toxic or non-toxic in nature. 

Different classification models are trained on the same dataset before comparing and identifying the best model for the classification task. Subsequently, the best model is utilised to classify web-scrabed Youtube comments to evaluate the model's performance. 

## Techniques
- Text Data Preprocessing
- Deep Learning Framework (TensorFlow)
- Word Embeddings (GloVe & BERT)
- Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN)
- Web Scraping of Youtube Comments (Selenium Library)

## Future Roadmap
- Implement Dense Classifier on BERT directly
